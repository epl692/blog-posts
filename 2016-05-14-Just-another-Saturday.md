title: Just another Saturday
---
Well, it's just another Saturday, and here I am taking some time off to write about it. Today consisted of work on the never ending pile of laundry, and learning to fold things the correct way. But I also had a bit of fun working on my Virtual Desktop system, and finishing installing Visual Studio on there. On a more personal side to things, my son James stood up for the very first time on his own, and we even got it on camera! It was super exciting to say the least. Little guy will be crawling in no time. Now to finish the day up I plan on watching the little ones and putting openSuse on my laptop. Time to try a new distro you know! (last one was fedora, I rather liked it, but I like the idea of a first class support for KDE4, so hey, time to try something new.

Type at you later,

Eric
