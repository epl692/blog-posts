title: Further transition to Emacs.
---
So, me again. Working on writing more to the blog, and to make that easier. On that front, I just hacked together some eLisp to allow me to write blog posts faster! Since every post is simply a file with a header, I figured it would not be too bad to write some eLisp that would take care of the details there. Turns out I was right! It took a few revisions, but here I type to you from Emacs, with just a few key strokes to create this post. I will give a more technical write up on the details later, but needless to say, I feel sold on the switch to Emacs. The support for automation is great.

Well, type at you later.
