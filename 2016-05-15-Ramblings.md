What is it that we do. Day in and day out I sit around wondering what we do. Maybe it's being in this limbo of being without a job, but it seems to me that when we don't do anything, we start to come up with jobs for ourselves. Like I have taken up writing from time to time, and also find myself toying with various programming and computer ideas.... everything from writing a basic compression system, to wanting to do more with technology. But what? What should I do. and to what end? I write code, but I rarely know what to write. I find myself more and more frustrated by the fact that I don't know what to do with myself. Well, okay, sometimes, like today, I find that sleeping out in the sun is an enjoyable activity, but there has to be more then that. I know, this entire post is dancing on the edge of the purpose of life, which is a question I could probably answer, and leave in a state of more questions. Like seriously, don't ask my why we are here. I know I am here because God has some purpose for me, but beyond that I don't quite know. Questions such as, when I am raising my children to love God, does he have some larger purpose for them? Not to say that anyone is unimportant, please don't presume I am thinking that at all, but do we simply raise the next generation, so that they can raise the next, and so on, and every so often greatness is requested of a generation, and so they rise to it? Or am I missing some calling in my life. There are various people I know that I have affected the direction of there lives, which is something I feel very honored to have been gifted the opportunity, but there are others, so many others, that come and go, and I feel there is a larger plan in the works, but it is just out of view. And when does all of this come together anyways? Will some day I look back and say "On April 1, 2014 I changed someones life", or will it be a more general thing that I come to relies. And there are the other events, the ones that for one reason or another I was present for, but did not play a part in. One such situation was when I was 16, just newly a driver on the road. I may not have even been quite there yet, since I was driving with my mother at the time. We where just leaving the grocery store, when a motorcyclist was run over by a van. My mother rushed to help, and I waited in the car, and watched as there was nothing that could be done to save his life. I pray he was a Christian and lives in Heaven with Christ now, but I do not even know his name. Or what about those other major events in ones life that they never forget. 9/11 was one of them. I didn't even understand fully what was going on at the time, but I know where I was when the towers where hit. I know what I was doing at the time, and I don't ever think I will forget. But why is that detail important? Was it not a group of selfish people, who decided that they would take there own lives, and the lives of countless others in order to do what? What a waste of life. They could have been scientists, and helped solve climate change, or they could have been economists and worked to make there homes a more stable place. But instead, they flew aircraft into buildings. Why? To what end? To incite a terrible evil, and make many many people live in fear? I know it sounds odd, maybe even Un-American, but I forgive them for what they have done. Why? Because it is the right thing to do. What good would it do to hate a few dead people? Does it make me morally superior to them? No. Does it undo the damage that they did? No. Does it bring anyone back to us that we have lost, ether in the buildings themselves, or to the war that followed? No. Evil must be punished. And we should attempt to preserve life the best way we can. But sometimes I feel like people would rather fight for peace then pray against a war. Do I think we will see the end to the violence in our world soon? Maybe. So say it is the end. I know at least at this moment it's not the end, sometimes it feels like it is, but then we go to bed, and wake up and raise our children another day. I guess where I am going with this is that, we should raise our children to love there neighbors, and to forgive. There is so much hate in this world, and it makes me sad.

My friends may you grow in grace, and in the power of Christ our Savior.
To God be the glory. Amen. So be it.
