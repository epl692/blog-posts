Preface
-------

So, for the longest time I have been in the [Vim][vim] camp. It's a nice editor, and I love it. Does what I need it to do, and I could potentially expand on it.

Well, then I started learning the Lisp programming language, and quickly found myself using [Emacs][Emacs] for lisp tasks, and I found that writing expansions for Emacs was, well, easy once you have the basics of lisp down. I am still switching between the two, but I plan on documenting my journey here.

Getting started
---------------

First Week

Well, for a vim user, Emacs is.... different. But different is not always bad. I find that the keyboard shortcuts are becoming more and more intuitive as I go. It's int resting to remember not to type vim at the shell, but, it's just something I am going to have to learn to do.
